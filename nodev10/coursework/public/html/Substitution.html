				A simple substituion is where you can write out the alphabet in a different order than normal and convert the text over into the new alphabet, this is sometimes called a substitution alphabet.
				One method of this would be a Mixed alphabet, this is created by writing out a word, removing repeated letters and then write all the remaining letters in normal order.

				There are two options for the Subsituation Cipher.
				If you would like to create a cipher text click on encrypt in the dropdown box, then enter the orgional alphabet in the first box(for example this might be the english alphabet), then enter your version of the alphabet, you might want to try the mixed alphabet method, in the final box enter whatever text you would like converted and then click the setup new alphabet and encrypt button
				if you would like to decrypt some ciphered text click on the decrpt in the dropdown box.then enter the orgional alphabet(the orgional alphabet used, so if it was english enter the english alphabet again), then enter the modified version that was used to encrypt it in the next box, then enter the encrypted text and click on the setup old alphabet and decrypt button.
