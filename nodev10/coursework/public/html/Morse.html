				Morse Code Encodes text characters as standard squences of dots and dashes.There is a Standard for the amount of time each dot,dash and space should take. a dot is one unit, a dash is three units, the space between each dot and dash in the same letter is one unit, the space between letters is three units and the space between words is seven units.
